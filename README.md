# WorkLogger


## Problem we're solving


WorkLogger is a simple to use application, that'll make work time logging easier for those, who still rely on Excel-sheets. Trust me, I've been there...


## Technically?


Application is using Electron.js/Node.js as platform and UI is built with React.js. On the background, the application uses the magical abilities of the Microsoft PowerShell to give you one single XLSX-file you can send to your accountant.


You can set the fields from settings. For example you can have date, day of week, task and hours you used to the task. Or you can have much more detailed classification for the entry.
Idea is to add different entries for different tasks so your accounting can calculate where all the workforce is dedicated to. Or you can have just entries for whole work day, if you don't need that specific sheet.
